# E-Invoice Chatbot UI/UX Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a Streamlit-based chatbot application that will answer questions about e-invoice data, with support for both English and Arabic languages, table-based filtering, and interactive visualizations.

## UI Components

### 1. Header Section
- Application title in both English and Arabic
- Brief description of the chatbot's capabilities
- Language selector (English/Arabic)

### 2. Sidebar
- **Data Filter Panel**:
  - Dropdown to select specific data tables (Invoices, Items, Taxpayers, Audit Logs)
  - Option to filter by domain area (Tax Compliance, Fraud Detection, Revenue Analysis, Geographic Distribution)
  - Date range selector (if applicable)
- **API Configuration**:
  - Text input for ChatGPT API key
  - Model selection dropdown (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
  - Temperature/creativity slider

### 3. Main Chat Interface
- Chat history display area (scrollable)
- Message input box with send button
- Clear conversation button
- Example questions button/dropdown

### 4. Visualization Area
- Dynamic area for displaying interactive graphs
- Options to download visualizations
- Toggle between different visualization types when applicable

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial State**:
   - User is greeted with welcome message in selected language
   - Brief instructions on how to use the chatbot
   - Suggestion to enter API key in sidebar

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User enters a question
   - System analyzes question to determine relevant data tables/domains
   - If ambiguous, system may ask for clarification on which table to query
   - Loading indicator while processing

3. **Response Display**:
   - Text response in selected language
   - Relevant interactive visualization when applicable
   - Options to ask follow-up questions

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Clear error messages for missing API key
   - Guidance when questions are outside the domain scope
   - Fallback responses when data is insufficient

## Multilingual Support

### English UI Text
- All UI elements will have English labels and instructions
- Example questions in English
- System messages in English

### Arabic UI Text
- All UI elements will have Arabic translations
- Right-to-left (RTL) layout support
- Arabic example questions
- System messages in Arabic

## Interactive Visualization Types

1. **Time Series Charts**:
   - For questions about trends over time
   - Interactive zoom and hover details

2. **Bar/Column Charts**:
   - For comparative questions (e.g., "Which emirate has the highest fraud rate?")
   - Color-coded by risk level or category

3. **Pie/Donut Charts**:
   - For distribution questions (e.g., "What's the distribution of invoice types?")
   - Interactive segment selection

4. **Heatmaps**:
   - For correlation questions
   - Interactive cell highlighting

5. **Geographic Maps**:
   - For location-based questions
   - Interactive zoom and region selection

## Table Filtering Logic

The chatbot will route questions to the appropriate data tables based on:

1. **Explicit Mentions**:
   - Direct references to table names (e.g., "Show me anomalies in the invoices table")
   - References to fields specific to certain tables

2. **Semantic Routing**:
   - Question intent analysis to determine relevant tables
   - Domain-specific keyword matching

3. **Default Hierarchy**:
   - If ambiguous, prioritize: Invoices > Items > Taxpayers > Audit Logs
   - Consider user's previous interactions for context

## Domain Knowledge Integration

The chatbot will incorporate knowledge about:
- E-invoice standards and regulations
- Tax compliance requirements in UAE
- Common fraud patterns and detection methods
- Financial analysis terminology
- Geographic information about UAE emirates

## Technical Considerations

1. **Font Handling**:
   - Use system default configuration for multilingual text
   - Ensure proper rendering of Arabic characters in both UI and visualizations

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure UI adapts to different screen sizes
   - Optimize visualization layout for mobile and desktop

3. **Performance**:
   - Implement efficient data loading and caching
   - Optimize API calls to minimize latency
